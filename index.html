  <h3>Education and Qualifications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> In 2022 to 2023 I took a course in home from udemy named "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" </li>
    <br>
    <li> In 2018 to 2021 I went to Middlesex University in London to make my Biomedical Engineer graduation. Were I learned about the diferent ways to Design Engineering, diferent ways to safe and effective usage of medical equipment,
      learned Eletronic's, Mechanic‚Äôs, Biomechanics as well as usefull softwares to go a long with. </li>
    <br>
    <li> In 2021 to 2018 I study Science and Technology at senior school Calazans Duarte School </li>
